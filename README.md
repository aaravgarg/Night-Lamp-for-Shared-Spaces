# Night-Lamp-for-Shared-Spaces
We solved a roommate issue: balancing light for one working late while the other sleeps. Our lamp uses RGB LEDs and Arduino to cast amber light at the top and red light in the middle, minimizing disruption. A light detector turns the lamp on when the main light goes off.

I won a cash prize of $50 from Autodesk for this project.
